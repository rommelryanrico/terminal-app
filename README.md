## Motivation & Inspiration

Ryan: The idea for this application came to me after my experience of the first week of this course. I was feeling quite overwhelmed with everything and my stress levels were at an all time high. I eventually imploded by the end of the week and lost all confidence in myself. But through talking with friends, family and peers. I was able to forget my worries, reframe my thinking and remember the reasons why I decided to do this course.

## Build Process

Our primary aim was to create an application that would provide a set of activities to the user based on how they were feeling at the time. The activities would help the user to reset their mind, feel positive emotions and also remember their own reasons for doing this course. The program would then create a file for them to keep their journal entries for self reflection.

We really set our focus on the experience of the app. It was really important to us that the user felt like they were talking to someone real, which we tried to convey through the language used and the way the information was presented, in order to build comfort and familiarity with the user.

## Features

1. Provides a set of activities based on how the user is feeling.
2. Activities include a breathing exercise, an affirmation exercise, a physical activity exercise and a random joke generator.
3. After every activity, it asks the user a question designed to elicit positive emotions.
4. Provides at the end of the program, a list of the user's journal entries for their own self reflection.
